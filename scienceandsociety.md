The article that I selected as my #1 claim is the article by The Globe and Mail, listed above with the following URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-alarm-about-climate-change-is-blinding-us-to-sensible-solutions/. This article is an excerpt from Bjorn Lomborg’s book False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs us Trillions, Hurts the Poor and Fails to Fix the Planet (Lomborg, B., 2020). 

The primary argument being made by this article is that climate claims are exaggerated, but not negating that they are in fact accurate. Lomborg emphasis the fact that current focus on the climate crisis is resulting in attention being deflected away from other global issues. The article uses the current Covid-19 pandemic as an example. Tuberculosis is still the leading cause of death in the world; however, the majority of relief efforts are being directed towards aiding Covid-19 patients. Similarly, the author attempts to emphasize the point that climate change is not the biggest issue that we are experiencing as a global entity, however it is the one that the most emphasis is placed on.

Assessing the credibility of a source is integral to critically asses the information that we are consuming. Using the RADAR (Relevance, Author, Date, Appearance and Relevance) technique to assess the credibility we start with the relevance of the article. This article is incredibly relevant to this assignment as it discusses the notion that climate change is an issue, however, the presentation of information may be flawed. The next step is to consider the author of the article. Bjorn Lomborg is the author of this article, and the recently published book False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor and Fails to Fix the Planet. On another website, Lomborg is listed as one of the most prevalent climate critiques (Campaign Against Climate Change 2010). It is obvious that he comes from an incredibly biased perspective and is known for his questioning opinions. This does not discredit the source; however, it requires readers to be aware of a potential bias when reading. The next RADAR aspect is the date. This article was published July 17, 2020, which is now 6 months ago. As such it should be known to the reader that this article is in fact older and may not be as updated as other more recent articles. The article itself does appear to be formally written and contains references and accurate information.  The overall conclusions regarding this article are that it does consist of accurate information, however, it is important to recognize that the information comes from a biased source undoubtedly. 

I chose this article as my number one pick solely for the fact that it was incredibly well written. A large majority of the other sources appeared to be from websites that were not entirely reliable and written by individuals who did not have a scientific background. This particular article was not only reputable but brought up valid concerns in a respectful and professional way. A lot of other articles were written to slander scientists and those that believe that climate change is an issue. As such, this article presented an opinion that was not based off of unjustified claims and lofty conclusions. Therefore, it was the article that made me question my own beliefs regarding climate change the most.


The issue with climate change is not the science itself, rather the politics associated with the ongoing discussion. As time has progressed it has resulted in facts being grossly exaggerated by politicians to emphasize various points. As evident through a variety of research, science is not separate from society (Grundmann, 2007). The validity of the claim itself is questionable. Climate change is for the most part, an indisputable issue. However, the need for climate change attention in the media calls into question whether this focus is actually going to change anything in the near future.
